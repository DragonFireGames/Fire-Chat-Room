FCR is a huge pain to keep online due to it getting spam reported, 
as such, I cannot keep it online at all times. If you wish to run 
FCR for yourself, here is the code for you to do so:

All the code in the libraries folder has to be put in separate 
projects and attached as gamelab libraries to the main projects.

[`FCR.js`](https://github.com/DragonFireGames/Fire-Chat-Room/blob/main/FCR.js) -> Original FCR in all its glory<br>
Dependencies:
<br>- [`Vault.js`](https://github.com/DragonFireGames/Fire-Chat-Room/blob/main/libraries/Vault.js) (Optional, Strongly recommended)
<br>- [`FullEmojiList.js`](https://github.com/DragonFireGames/Fire-Chat-Room/blob/main/libraries/FullEmojiList.js) (Optional)

[`FCR2.js`](https://github.com/DragonFireGames/Fire-Chat-Room/blob/main/FCR2.js) -> New Version of FCR which uses the cdo-backend<br>
Dependencies:
<br>- [`FGUI.js`](https://github.com/DragonFireGames/Fire-Chat-Room/blob/main/libraries/FGUI.js) (Required)
<br>- [`FKEY.js`](https://github.com/DragonFireGames/Fire-Chat-Room/blob/main/libraries/FKEY.js) (Required)
