FCR is a huge pain to keep online due to it getting spam reported, 
as such, I cannot keep it online at all times. If you wish to run 
FCR for yourself, here is the code for you to do so:

All the code in the libraries folder has to be put in separate 
projects and attached as gamelab libraries to the main projects.

FCR.js -> Original FCR in all its glory
Dependencies:
- Vault.js (Optional, Strongly recommended)
- FullEmojiList.js (Optional)

FCR2.js -> New Version of FCR which uses the cdo-backend
Dependencies:
- FGUI.js (Required)
- FKEY.js (Required)
- Vault.js (Required)
- FullEmojiList.js (Optional)

Check out cdo-backend as well:
