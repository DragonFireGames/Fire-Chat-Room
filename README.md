FCR is a huge pain to keep online due to it getting spam reported, 
as such, I cannot keep it online at all times. If you wish to run 
FCR for yourself, here is the code for you to do so:

All the code in the libraries folder has to be put in separate 
projects and attached as gamelab libraries to the main projects.

<h3>FCR.js -> Original FCR in all its glory</h3><br>
Dependencies:
<br>\- Vault.js (Optional, Strongly recommended)
<br>\- FullEmojiList.js (Optional)

<h3>FCR2.js -> New Version of FCR which uses the cdo-backend</h3><br>
Dependencies:
<br>\- FGUI.js (Required)
<br>\- FKEY.js (Required)
<br>\- Vault.js (Required)
<br>\- FullEmojiList.js (Optional)
